Task 1<br/>

![](wireframe.png) <br/>

For the Mobile layout on this page we could: <br/>
1 - I assume that search is global (searching the whole site not just that page) so I would move search input and button to the navigation, so we would have search input with the button as a first or last option in the navigation with the history, logout etc. Navigation would be placed in a collapsable element that woould enter the view from the right side, and it would be called by clicking on the header button. So in the header we would have Wiki logo and navigation button on each side.<br/>
2 - Breadcrumbs would be placed bellow the header or it would be hidden on small screens if there is not enough space.<br/>
3- Side bar with its options would be transfered into tabs placed horizontaly right bellow breadcrumbs. If on some page there is more than 3 side bar options, tabs can be displayed as options of a dropdown button. If they are used very often they can stick on the top as soon as user starts to scroll. If we are short in space we could place a sticki button on the bottom right side and on click that button would present these options. That way we can manage to save some horizontal space but it would not be clear for the first users. <br/>
4- Main article would stay the same bellow the navigation, breadcrumbs? and tabs. Title would be cented with flag, mail, print icons right bellow in the center. And the text would follow after icons. Lins on the bottom of the article can be presented horizontaly or if the number of the links can very and be larger they can be placed in a collapsable element that can have few links visible and more or ... clickable element that can display all the links.<br/>
5 - Comments can be presented with the slider, first 5-10 comments would be a part of the slider with only 1 comment visible at the time. Bellow the slider there can be 2 buttons for adding a comment and for seeing all comments. These 2 buttons would each open a new element, first form for adding a comment, second a paginated list of comments with all comments.<br/>
